# Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure code for the platform belongs here and must trace back to the approved platform design entities in [knowledge-model-platform-engineering](../knowledge-model-platform-engineering/).

This folder contains a deployable Terraform boilerplate for the Microsoft Azure + Microsoft Fabric data platform. It is intentionally parameterized so generated `platform-spec/` YAML can later be translated into environment `*.tfvars` or direct HCL updates by prompt.

## Deployment model

The approved platform implementation split is intentionally separated by deployment plane:

- Azure resources: `azurerm`
- Fabric capacity as an Azure resource: `azurerm_fabric_capacity`
- Fabric control plane, workspaces, and RBAC: `microsoft/fabric`
- Fabric items: `fabric-cicd` or Fabric REST APIs, to be added after workspace foundation
- Secrets: workload identity/federation and Azure Key Vault
- State: protected Azure Storage remote backend

## Basic Workflow

1. Fill an environment `terraform.tfvars` from `terraform.tfvars.example`.
2. Copy `backend.tf.example` to `backend.tf` and point it at the approved remote-state account.
3. Authenticate to Azure and Microsoft Fabric with an identity that can create Azure resources and manage Fabric workspaces.
4. Run from the target environment folder:

```powershell
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file terraform.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file terraform.tfvars
```

The Fabric provider needs permission to see the Fabric capacity before assigning workspaces to it. If the data source cannot resolve a newly created capacity during the same run, set `fabric_capacity_id_override` to the Fabric capacity GUID and re-run.

## Spec Mapping

Use [PLATFORM_SPEC_MAPPING.md](PLATFORM_SPEC_MAPPING.md) when generating or refreshing `terraform.tfvars` from the `platform-spec/` YAML tree.

## Implementation Guidance

- Keep Azure, Fabric control plane, and Fabric item deployment in separate pipeline stages.
- Store shared state in a protected remote backend and avoid local state persistence.
- Use workload identity and Key Vault rather than embedded secrets in pipeline code.
- Preserve the validated architecture decisions for subscriptions, networking, retention, Entra ID, and cost governance.

## Verification Notes

Provider and resource shapes were checked against current documentation for:

- Fabric capacity: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/fabric_capacity
- Fabric workspace: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/fabric/latest/docs/resources/workspace
- Fabric workspace RBAC: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/fabric/latest/docs/resources/workspace_role_assignment
- Microsoft Fabric capacities ARM/Terraform AzAPI reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.fabric/capacities

`terraform` and `tofu` were not installed in the shell used to scaffold this repository, so `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` could not be run there. Static checks were run for expected files, balanced braces, and unresolved `var.*`, `local.*`, and `module.*` references.

## Minimal development configuration

The dev root contains only azure-landing-zone, fabric-capacity,
fabric-workspace, and fabric-rbac module calls. Its example configures
one resource group, an F2 capacity in swedencentral, and one workspace
with the approved user as Admin.

Networking, storage, Key Vault, and monitoring modules remain available
but are not invoked by dev. Their legacy dev input declarations are inert.
Test and production retain their existing scaffold.

Before human deployment, supply the actual subscription/tenant IDs and
verified target-tenant principal ID in an untracked terraform.tfvars.
Confirm deployment permissions, guest access, applicable licensing,
capacity availability, a reviewed budget, and a protected existing backend.
Backend provisioning is outside the initial scope.

Terraform was unavailable while preparing this change. On Windows,
installation can be requested with winget install Hashicorp.Terraform.
Formatting and validation remain required before readiness approval.
The kit never performs real-credential terraform plan or apply.
